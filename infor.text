## About Me

I'm **Kanishka Gunawardana**, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, currently serving as a Temporary Instructor in the Department of Computer Engineering. My journey in computing began with childhood curiosity about an old Intel Pentium IV computer—a curiosity that evolved into a deep passion for understanding and building computer systems from the ground up.

### Academic Excellence
I graduated with a B.Sc. Engineering (Hons.) in Computer Engineering, achieving a perfect **GPA of 4.0/4.0** and ranking **1st in my field out of 90 students**. My academic foundation was built on a strong performance in the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination, where I secured a **national rank of 149 out of 19,508 candidates**.

### Research & Expertise
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Architecture, Neuromorphic Computing, Embedded Systems, and Intelligent Systems**. I'm particularly passionate about:

- **Neuromorphic Computing**: Currently working with the PeraMorphIQ Neuromorphic Research Group, developing brain-inspired computing systems for edge applications
- **Hardware-Software Co-Design**: Exploring how architectural choices can enable efficient, intelligent behavior in hardware
- **System Optimization**: Specializing in performance analysis and power optimization for computing systems

### Notable Projects

**SNAP-V: RISC-V SoC with Neuromorphic Acceleration** (Final Year Thesis)
My undergraduate thesis focused on designing a RISC-V-based system-on-chip with configurable neuromorphic acceleration for small-scale spiking neural networks. This project combined my interests in computer architecture and brain-inspired computing, targeting power-efficient edge applications in robotics and IoT.

**JPEG Encoding Optimization Research** (Published at IEEE ICAC 2024)
Developed a pipelined multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) that significantly improved JPEG encoding throughput through custom hardware instructions and architectural optimizations on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA.

**Impact Tracking System for Athletes**
Led the hardware and firmware development for a real-time head impact monitoring system for contact sports, integrating wearable sensors with cloud-based analytics to support player safety and concussion detection.

### Professional Experience
- **Temporary Instructor** at University of Peradeniya: Teaching computer architecture and embedded systems, mentoring research teams on neuromorphic accelerators and on-chip learning
- **Software Engineering Intern** at WSO2 LLC: Developed Ballerina integrations including the OpenAI Finetunes Connector and ISO20022-to-SwiftMT message conversion systems

### Recognition & Achievements
- **1st Runners-up** at SLIot Challenge 2023 (Sri Lanka's biggest IoT competition, 100+ teams)
- **4th Place Nationally** at MoraXtreme 8.0 algorithmic programming competition (400+ teams)
- **Global Rank 374** in IEEEXtreme 17.0 (out of 16,500+ participants)

### Technical Capabilities
I work across the full spectrum of computing—from transistor-level design to system-level integration. My toolkit includes:
- **Hardware Design**: Verilog HDL, RISC-V, Chisel, FPGA development
- **EDA Tools**: Synopsys Design Compiler, VCS, PrimeTime, PrimePower
- **Software Development**: Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, frameworks including Express.js, FastAPI, React.js
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, with coursework from Stanford's Machine Learning Specialization

### Philosophy
For me, engineering is about **breaking boundaries**—taking what exists today and improving it for tomorrow. I believe in the power of understanding systems from the inside out, where small architectural improvements can create significant real-world impact. Whether it's optimizing a processor pipeline, designing neuromorphic accelerators, or building embedded systems, I approach each challenge with curiosity and a commitment to pushing the limits of what's possible.

### Beyond Academia
I'm actively involved in the academic community through leadership roles in the Robotics Society at the University of Peradeniya, where I served as Head of Web Development, and through volunteer work with Project Nenathambara. Teaching and mentoring have become integral to my growth, helping me communicate complex technical concepts while staying connected to fundamental principles.

### Current Focus
I'm continuing my research in neuromorphic computing, mentoring teams on next-generation neuromorphic accelerators with on-chip learning capabilities, and exploring opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge research in hardware-software co-design and intelligent systems. My goal is to build systems that are efficient, adaptive, and capable of powering the next generation of computing for robotics and edge devices.
